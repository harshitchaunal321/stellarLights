                Stellar Lights began as a unique collaboration between Fremantle Biennale, a contemporary arts festival, and Global Unmanned Systems, specialists in complex drone operations.</br> </br>During the global pandemic, Fremantle Biennale envisioned a spectacular drone show for its Crossing 21 festival. With no local expertise available, they partnered with Global Unmanned Systems to create Moombaki, Australia's first large-scale drone spectacle. Featuring over 160 drones, Moombaki illuminated Fremantle's waterways, bringing ancient Nyoongar creation stories vividly to life.</br></br> This groundbreaking project established Stellar Lights as Australia's leading drone entertainment provider, combining cultural storytelling with innovative drone technology to deliver unforgettable experiences nationwide.
